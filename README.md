# Fish-Feeder
Set up a hydroponic garden / fish tank installation using a hardware such as sensors that could measure the temperature pH and water depth in the fish tank and help determine when the pump needs to be turned on.
# Problem Statement:
For our team project, the group was tasked to set up a hydroponic garden / fish tank installation using a hardware such as sensors that could measure the temperature pH and water depth in the fish tank and help determine when the pump needs to be turned on. Using Python, the group has interacted an Arduino to dynamically collect sensor data and record the temperature over a set amount of time with the temperature displayed at regular intervals.


## Hardware Setup

![Alt-text](/doc/temp_sensor1.jpg "Alt-title")

Arduino is connected to the computer via a mini-USB 


## Future Work

This project was quite interesting to set up the hydroponic fish garden. While using Python, the program was taking time initialize the code itself to get some values of the temperature vs time. For future work, another group could write a program that can control not only the temperature but other aspects such as the lighting, water flow/waste inside the fish garden. And all of these could be fully automated and controlled remotely using a smartphone.
