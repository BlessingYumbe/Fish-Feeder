# Fish-Feeder
Set up a hydroponic garden / fish tank installation using a hardware such as sensors that could measure the temperature pH and water depth in the fish tank and help determine when the pump needs to be turned on.
# Problem Statement:
For our team project, the group was tasked to set up a hydroponic garden / fish tank installation using a hardware such as sensors that could measure the temperature pH and water depth in the fish tank and help determine when the pump needs to be turned on. Using Python, the group has interacted an Arduino to dynamically collect sensor data and record the temperature over a set amount of time with the temperature displayed at regular intervals.

## Arduino Code
The [fish_feeder.ino](fish_feeder.ino) sketch was uploaded on the Arduino using the Arduino IDE.

## Python Code

The [fish_feerder.py](fish_feerder.py) script was run in python.

## Results

## Future Work
This project was quite interesting to set up with the hydroponic fish garden. While using Python, the program was taking time initialize the code itself to prevent multiple ThingSpeak write requests in too short of a time. For future work, another group improve the communication scheme to reduce this delay and prevent failed requests to dispense food.  Additionally, another group could add hardware that can monitor and control conditions such as temperature, lighting, water flow/waste inside the fish garden. And all of these could be fully automated and controlled remotely using a smartphone.
